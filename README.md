# Factory Functions and The Module Pattern

## Lesson Objectives

1. How to write a factory method that returns an object
2. Explain how "scope" works in JavaScript
3. Explain what "Closure" is and how it impacts private functions & variables
4. Describe how private functions & variables are useful
5. Explain the module pattern
6. Describe IIFE. What does it stand for?

### What is Factory Function?

- The factory function pattern is similar to constructors
- Instead of using "new" to create an object, factory functions simply set up and return the new object when you call the function

### Scope and Closure

- scope - refers to where things like variables and functions can be used in your code
- closure - is like a secret hiding spot in the toy box that only the function can access

### Private Variables and Functions

- we can hide variables and functions from the outside world

### Module Pattern

- similar to factory functions but being execute right away
